# Data Science Project: Sales Data Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing a dataset containing sales data of a store from the US. It encompasses data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to derive actionable insights. The project demonstrates foundational data science skills and offers a glimpse into practical data analysis workflows.

## Objectives

- **Data Analysis**: Explore the dataset to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Data Cleaning**: Address missing values and inconsistencies to ensure data quality.
- **Data Visualization**: Create visual representations to illustrate key findings and trends.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Handled missing values and data inconsistencies.
   - Standardized data formats and addressed outliers.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.
   

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Created various plots (e.g., line plots, bar charts, histograms) using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
   - Visualized sales trends, distribution, and other insights.

## Dataset
